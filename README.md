# Stopwatch Lab

We're gonna make: a stopwatch, replicating http://potoo-stopwatch.surge.sh/.

Use the provided `Button.js` component file - it won't need any modification!

Fill out the `App.js` component file, and fill out and use the `Display.js` component file.

1. Wireframe it, paying attention to which parts of the UI correspond to which Components.
2. Set up a `Start` button that just starts the stopwatch, and hook a display for that. 
3. Add a `Pause` button that pauess the stopwatch.
4. Ensure that when you press `Start` again, the stopwatch starts _from the currently displayed time_.
5. Add a `Reset` button, that resets the current time.
